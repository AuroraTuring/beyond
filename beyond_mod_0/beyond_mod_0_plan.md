From now until Mod 1 I will be doing a lot of planning and scheduling for medical appointments. I will also still be practicing my Mod 0 skills weekly. I would like to use the time to prepare my room, which is also my workspace, to be more friendly towards long hours at the computer. I plan to purchase a nice seat cushion, change my lightbulb to a dimmable one, and get some stim toys to have handy for when I need some self regulation. I'll be figuring out how to meal prep for the upcoming module as well.
